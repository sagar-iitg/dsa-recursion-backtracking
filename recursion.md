####
when a function call itself is called Recursion


###
1. Base Condition (mandatory)
2. Recursive Relation/ Recursive call (mandatory)
3. Processing (optional -- depends on question)


### Observation:
* Most of the time in base case we need to write return keyword


### HEAD RECURSION
* BaseCase -> Recursive relation -> Processing

### Tail Recursion
* BaseCase-> Processing -> Recursive relation
